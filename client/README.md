# Commit Messages - IMPORTANT!

The commit message should be structured as follows

###`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
Example: 
```bash 
feat(lang): added French language
fix(server): fixed 404 error in /GET requests
```

###`fix:`
a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
###`feat: `
a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).

# Branching - IMPORTANT!

We never work on the ```main``` branch.
If you are working on the feature/bug/etc., you need to create a local branch first,
preferably in the following format:

```<your name>/<work scope>```

For example:  ```masha/orderBackend```

When you finish your work, you should open a Pull Request and wait for a reviewer to approve the changes. We never push to the  ```main``` branch. We never merge the PR without it to be reviewed AND approved.
